#What? GET

### What this is
Get all of the freeleech torrents from what.cd. They get kind of mad if you use this since I put it on the internet, so be careful. 

### Usage 
Fill out user_info.txt:
```sh
username:bob
password:bobspassword
``` 
Set the permissions of what_get.sh and run it
```sh
$ chmod +x what_get.sh
$ ./what_get.sh
```
All the torrent files will be dumped in the current directory.
